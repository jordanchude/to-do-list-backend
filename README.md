## Project Description

For my unit 02 project, I am going to create a to-do list tracker for a company and its employees. For the backend, each user request will either create a new employee (with their name, title, and to-do items displayed), edit/update an employee, delete an employee, create a new to-do item for a specific employee, edit/update a to-do item, or delete a to-do item. As each employee or employee to-do is created, edited or updated on the webpage, it'll be sent to a backend server to update the relevant data and show the user an updated webpage to reflect the changes.

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.
