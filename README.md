## Project Description

For my unit 02 project, I am going to create a to-do list tracker for a company and its employees. For the backend, each user request will either create a new employee (with their name, title, and to-do items displayed), edit/update an employee, delete an employee, create a new to-do item for a specific employee, edit/update a to-do item, or delete a to-do item. As each employee or employee to-do is created, edited or updated on the webpage, it'll be sent to a backend server to update the relevant data and show the user an updated webpage to reflect the changes.
